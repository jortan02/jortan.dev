A coursework project for CS 5140 (Data Mining) that employed data analytics and statistical predictions on user data from MyAnimeList. In a team of three, we applied Misraâ€“Gries to obtain frequently favorited anime, Jaccard similarity to find similar anime, and matrix factorization to predict user scores.
