### Overview

CleanRAG is an interactive tool built with Streamlit, designed to help developers and researchers optimize their Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The application allows users to upload documents, configure text splitting and indexing strategies, and interact with the processed data through a chat interface.

### Key Features

- Intuitive interface for document management and configuration
- Support for multiple text splitting and indexing strategies
- Integration with a variety of language and embedding models
- Evaluation of pipeline performance using the Ragas framework
- Side-by-side configuration comparison for iterative optimization

### Technical Implementation

- Built with Streamlit for rapid UI development
- Indexing powered by LlamaIndex for flexible text chunking and retrieval
- Evaluation performed using Ragas metrics including faithfulness, context utilization, and answer relevance
- Users can load custom documents and QA datasets for hands-on analysis and comparison of different RAG configurations
