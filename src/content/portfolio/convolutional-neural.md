## Overview

This coursework project for CS 5353 (Deep Learning) demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of neural network fundamentals through the implementation of a complete convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using only NumPy. The project focuses on the mathematical principles behind CNNs while achieving competitive results on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset without relying on deep learning libraries.

## Key Achievements

- Achieved 68.7% test accuracy on CIFAR-10
- Surpassed the benchmark accuracy of 62%
- Built all core CNN components from first principles
- Successfully trained a multi-layer model using only NumPy

## Technical Implementation

- Implemented convolutional layers with custom kernels
- Developed max pooling layers for downsampling
- Created batch normalization for training stability
- Built ReLU activation and softmax output layers
- Designed fully connected layers for classification
- Wrote backpropagation logic for all components
