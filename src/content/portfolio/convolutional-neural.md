A coursework project for CS 5353 (Deep Learning) that creates a convolutional neural network for image
classification using NumPy. The network consisted of convolutional, max pool, batch norm, ReLU, fully connected, and softmax layers. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, I achieved 68.7% test accuracy and surpassed the expected accuracy of 62%.
