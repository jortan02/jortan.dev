### Overview

This coursework project for CS 4964 (Manage Data for & with ML) highlights the importance of data quality in machine learning workflows. The goal was to improve a regression model for flight delay prediction by applying structured data preprocessing and feature engineering to a noisy, real-world dataset.

### Key Achievements

- Reduced RMSE from 2,049,382 to 4.9 (99.99% improvement)
- Implemented robust data cleaning pipelines
- Developed automated feature engineering processes
- Created reproducible data transformation workflows

### Technical Implementation

- Designed and implemented data cleaning pipelines including missing value imputation and outlier handling
- Engineered features using normalization, encoding, and time-based extraction
- Built automated validation checks and transformation pipelines
- Applied cross-validation and correlation analysis for feature selection
