A solo project that focused on enhancing a regression model for flight delay prediction. I applied data engineering techniques to improve performance, designing data pipelines for imputation and feature engineering using scikit-learn. As a result, the model's RMSE was reduced from 2,049,382 to 4.9, significantly improving its predictive accuracy.
