A homework assignment for CS 4964 (Manage Data for & with ML) focused on teaching data cleaning techniques and pipeline development. Given an uncleaned dataset of flight data, I was tasked on enhancing a regression model for flight delay prediction. I applied data engineering techniques to improve performance, designing data pipelines for imputation and feature engineering using scikit-learn. As a result, the model's RMSE was reduced from 2,049,382 to 4.9, significantly improving its predictive accuracy.
