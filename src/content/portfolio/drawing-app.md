A coursework project for CS 4530 (Mobile Application Programming) to create an Android drawing app. Users can log in to the app, which is managed by Firebase. They can create drawings using a variety of tools and share them with other users. We used MVVM architecture, which made it easier to test individual components. I contributed to the foundational setup of the application, including Gradle configuration and navigation structure. I also developed the login screen, and implemented functionality for saving, loading, and deleting drawings.
