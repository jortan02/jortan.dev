## Overview

This coursework project for CS 4530 (Mobile Application Programming) demonstrates modern Android development practices and real-time collaboration features. The Drawing App is a feature-rich Android application that allows users to create, save, and share digital artwork. Built using Kotlin and following the MVVM architecture pattern, the app offers a smooth and intuitive drawing experience with robust user authentication, image augmentation, and cloud-backed persistence.

## Key Features

- User authentication and profile management via Firebase
- Multiple drawing tools: color picker and three brush types (normal, stamp, spray)
- Real-time collaborative drawing functionality
- Local storage and Firebase-based cloud synchronization
- Image augmentation tools implemented in C++ (invert, grayscale)
- Intuitive Material Design UI with responsive performance

## Technical Implementation

- Built on MVVM architecture to ensure scalability and testability
- Integrated Firebase Authentication for secure user access
- Implemented custom drawing tools and color selection logic
- Incorporated native C++ functions for image processing
- Stored drawings as image files locally and in the cloud
- Supported collaborative drawing using Firebase Realtime Database
- Managed UI state and data flow using Android Jetpack components

## My Contributions

- Set up the project's Gradle configuration and navigation structure
- Developed the login screen and integrated Firebase Authentication
- Implemented functionality for saving, loading, and deleting drawings
- Contributed to the foundational architecture of the application
