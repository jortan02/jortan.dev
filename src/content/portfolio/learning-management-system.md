A coursework project for CS 5530 (Database Systems) that created the back-end logic for a learning management system, like Canvas. This was a pair project, where we built a relational database from the ground up. First, we designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to model a user system with distinct permissions and roles (administrators, professors, and students). We then translated the diagram into a MySQL database, defining schemas and enforcing relational constraints. We then integrated this database with a website, using LINQ to execute dynamic queries.
