Not Piskel is a sprite sheet editor software created using QT. It features the ability to set a canvas size, paint pixels with a certain color using various tools (brush, rectangle, and fill), edit frames, and view the animation with a variable FPS. This was a team project for CS 3505 (Software Practice II) from the University of Utah.
