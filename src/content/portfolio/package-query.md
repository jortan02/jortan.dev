In this independent project, I experimented with three different executor strategies for evaluating package queries over an ingredient dataset. I implemented brute-force, ILP, and a simplified SketchRefine approach, formulating the latter two as integer linear programs using PuLP. The SketchRefine method achieved significantly faster runtimes, outperforming brute-force and achieving 75.9% faster execution compared to the ILP solution.
