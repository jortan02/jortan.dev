Parking Simulator is an educational app that teaches users how to park. It was created using C++, QT, and Box2D. Users can select between different parking scenarios, which present a different set of tips suitable for the situation at hand. Box2D was used for the logic of driving, handling, and collisions of the car. This was a team project for CS 3505 (Software Design II) for the University of Utah.
