## Overview

Parking Simulator is an educational desktop application designed to teach users various parking techniques through a realistic, physics-based simulation. Built using C++ with the Qt framework and Box2D physics engine, it combines practical tutorials with responsive vehicle control to deliver an engaging and effective learning experience.

## Key Features

- Multiple parking scenarios: parallel, perpendicular, and angled
- Physics-based vehicle movement and collision detection
- Interactive tutorials with real-time visual and textual feedback
- Realistic vehicle dynamics and obstacle interaction

## Technical Implementation

- Integrated Box2D to simulate accurate vehicle physics and handling
- Developed a vehicle control system responsive to keyboard inputs
- Built a scenario engine for tutorial progression and difficulty scaling
- Created a UI with Qt, including overlays and guidance elements
- Implemented a custom collision detection and feedback mechanism

## My Contributions

- Designed and implemented the world rendering and vehicle simulation logic
- Built a clear and interactive user interface using Qt
- Developed tutorial scenarios and level logic to support guided learning
