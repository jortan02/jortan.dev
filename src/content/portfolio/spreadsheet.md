## Overview

A comprehensive spreadsheet application developed as a pair project for CS 3500 (Software Design I) at the University of Utah. This project involved creating a fully functional spreadsheet application with capabilities similar to commercial spreadsheet software, including expression evaluation, data persistence, and an intuitive user interface, demonstrating software design principles and user interface development.

## Key Features

- Cell-based data entry and manipulation
- Mathematical expression evaluation
- XML-based file persistence
- Real-time cell updates and formula propagation
- Data validation and error reporting

## Technical Implementation

- Built a cell management system for tracking contents and dependencies
- Developed an expression parser and evaluator for formula support
- Implemented XML serialization/deserialization for file saving/loading
- Created a dynamic and responsive UI using WinForms
- Designed a dependency graph to manage formula updates and prevent cycles
- Implemented robust error handling for invalid formulas and input
