TankWars is an online multiplayer game. Each player is a tank that can move around the map and can earn points by destroying other tanks. This was a pair project for CS 3500 (Software Design I) at the University of Utah. We built this using WinForms and adhered to MVC design principles. To facilitate communications, we used a client-server architecture, where the server managed game events and synchronized client views via TCP sockets with JSON-formatted messages.
